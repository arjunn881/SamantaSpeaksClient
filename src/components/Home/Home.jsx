                <p>
                  Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT), a household
                  name in the education sector, has become a sought-after
                  destination in India for professional studies. It is admired
                  all over for the quality of its academic courses, its
                  community outreach work and as a university of compassion and
                  humanitarianism. It has become a case study because no other
                  educational institution in India has grown in its scope and
                  scale as much as KIIT has in a short span of 25 years. Its
                  incredible transformation is truly a journey from Soil to
                  Silver.
